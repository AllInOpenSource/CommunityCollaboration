# Community Collaboration - All In for Maintainers

Summary: This repository coordinates DEI support between open source projects.

## About This Project

The Community Collaboration project is designed to coordinate DEI support between open source projects. During the Maintaner's Listening Tour, one theme that surfaced was that smaller, less resourced open source projects need help with tasks related to diversity, equity or inclusion, but they don't have the capacity to attend to them. Alternatively, larger, more well-resourced projects *do* have the capacity, and can lend a hand when needed. This project acts as a go-between to connect these two categories of projects.

## How it Works

There are currently four types of tasks that can be done:
 
- Changing Master to Main
- Removing deadnames from the codebase
- Searching for and replacing non-inclusive terminology
- Setting up a Community DEI Survey

*Note: It's clear that there are an unlimited number of other tasks that are needed to improve diversity, equity and inclusion within open source projects, but this is a starting point. These are time-boxed and finite tasks that do not require long term commitments from volunteers. If you have suggestions for other DEI related tasks that your project needs or that you can provide, we'd love to hear them! Reach out to us at info@allinopensource.org.*

We use issues in this repo as an initial point of connection for this work. Maintainers can request help with one of these 4 tasks by opening an issue using the provided template. 

Maintainers from larger projects who are part of this community will monitor this repo and self-assign issues when they are able to provide help. It is then up to the maintainers from both projects to connect outside this repo to create a strategy and plan for implementation. **All work should happen in the project's repository, not this one.**

When the work is completed, either maintainer may jump back in this repository and close this issue to indicate that the work is done. 

## For Large Projects - Volunteering Your Services

If you are a maintainer from a larger project and you'd like to offer your help to smaller projects, we ask that you commit to these things:
 - A point of contact from the project to subscribe to this repo, keep up with notifications, and self-assign issues on behalf of the project
 - Timely coordination and implementation of the work
 
To join this initiative, you should:
1. Reach out to info@allinopensource.org to be added to the list of participating projects.
2. Assign a point of contact, and ask them to subscribe to this repo.
3. Self-assign issues as the project is able to take on the work requested.
4. Coordinate with your partner project **in their repo**.

## For Small Projects - Requesting Help

If you would like help in one of the 4 areas listed above, we ask that you commit to these things:
- Kindness and patience while waiting for a large project to claim your issue
- Timely coordination of the work

To join this initiative and request help, you should:
1. Open an issue in this repository using the template that's provided, and wait for a project to claim it.
2. Coordinate with your partner project **in your repo**.
3. Close this issue when the work is complete.
